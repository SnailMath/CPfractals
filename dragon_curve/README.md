These are basic programs for the Classpad II.
These programs will display the dragon curve.
Import all 5 files onto the calc into the same folder.
Start the program draSt2 or draSt7 to start the program.

`draSt2` will draw the dragon curve the usual way using the fuction in the file
drar2.

`draSt7` will draw an image similar to the dragon curve that looks more detailled and filled using the algorithm in variable drar7 and dra5px.
`drar7` works similar to drar2, but the image is half the size. Instead of
drawing the lines itself, this program draws the area that would be inclosed (sort of, every 'square' with 2 lines as neighbours gets drawn). 

The folder pictures contains the pictures I took, you can use them as end screen or as graph background.
