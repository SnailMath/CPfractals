# CPfractals
Just a few programs for the classpad II to generate fractals.

## Dragon Curve ##
The dragon curve programmed in basic, including picture files.

## Sierpinski Triangle ##
The sierpinski triangle as basic program and hhk program. Just to compare the calculation speed.

(in basic size 8 takes almost 10 seconds, in asm (loaded using hollyhock) it takes less than a second, even in size 128)
